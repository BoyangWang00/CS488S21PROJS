# Course Description

This course provides a top-down study of modern computer networking and the Internet. Application layer topics include the Web, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, and socket programming. Transport layer topics include UDP, TCP, and congestion control. Network layer topics include link state routing, distance vector routing, IPv4, RIP, OSPF, BGP, IPv6, multicasting and IGMP, and mobile IP. Local area network topics include Ethernet, IEEE, 802.11, and Bluetooth.

# Textbook

* **[Required]**  Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, By James F. Kurose; Keith W. Ross. Edition: 6,  ISBN:9780132856201

# Objectives

1. Understand the fundamental concepts of computer networks, particularly as related to the Internet;
2. Understand the multi-layer model of modern network architecture and its advantages and complexities;
3. Understand application layer messages and protocols, and write application layer software using sockets;
4. Understand transport layer functionality and explain how congestion control is implemented on the Internet;
5. Understand inter-networking and network layer functionality, and explain how routing is implemented on the Internet and network management;
6. Understand local area networks and link-layer issues including the details of the Ethernet and
IEEE 802.11 protocols;
7. Demonstrate your understanding of the material through a final project uploaded to GitHub.
