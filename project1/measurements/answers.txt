Q2) Add the round trip time of L1, L2, and L3 for the latency from h1 to h4.
    (40 * 2 + 10 * 2 + 30 * 2) = 160 ms
    
    The throughput between h1 and h4 would be limited by the throughput of L1 (20 Mbps).
    
Q3) The latency of two pairs of hosts communicating through the same links would be double
    the latency of just one pair of hosts.
    Ex. L1-L2-L3  double latency = 160 * 2 = 320 ms
    
    Or, the latency might remain the same due to the switches maintaining the two or more       communications simultaneously between mutiple pairs.
    
    The throughput between two pairs of hosts communicating through the same links would either be half the normal throughput between one pair
    of hosts or remain the same because the switches have the compacity to maintain multiple communications simultaneously.

Q4) The throughput between h1 and h4 at max would be 20 Mbps due to the limiting bandwidth
    of L1. Meanwhile, the throughput betwee h5 and h6 at max would be 25 Mbps due to the
    identical bandwidth of L4 and L5.
    Therefore, the max throughput while the two pairs of
    hosts communicate simultaneously would be 45 Mbps (20 + 25 Mbps), and there would be a
    5 Mbps data loss total.
    
    The latency between the two pairs of hosts might remains the same:
    h1-h4: 160 ms
    h5-h6: (10 + 20 + 10 =) 40 ms
    
    Or, if the latency of L2 does change due to the pairs of hosts sharing it, L2 latency
    would be doubled from 20 ms to 40 ms. Therefore, an overall changed latency would be
    equal would 180 ms between h1-h4 and 60 ms between h5-h6.
