Q2) Prediction: Add the round trip time of L1, L2, and L3 for the latency from h1 to h4.
    (40 * 2 + 10 * 2 + 30 * 2) = 160 ms

    The throughput between h1 and h4 would be limited by the throughput of L1 (20 Mbps).

    Result:
    rtt avg = 171.619 ms
    rate=21.583 Mbps


Q3)
    Prediction:
    The latency of two pairs of hosts communicating through the same links would be double
    the latency of just one pair of hosts.
    Ex. L1-L2-L3  double latency = 160 * 2 = 320 ms

    Or, the latency might remain the same due to the switches maintaining the two or more communications simultaneously between mutiple pairs.

    The throughput between two to three pairs of hosts communicating simultaneously through the same links would slow down because the throughput will be split
    depending on number of hosts.

    Result:
    ---2 pairs of hosts----
    Latency
    h1-h4: rtt= 171.369 ms
    h7-h8: rtt= 171.335 ms

    Throughput
    h1-h4: rate=12.956 Mbps
    h7-h8: rate=9.962 Mbps

    ---3 pairs of hosts---
    Latency
    h1-h4: rtt= 170.406 ms
    h7-h8: rtt= 170.811 ms
    h9-h10: rtt= 169.937 ms

    Throughput
    h1-h4: rate=6.124 Mbps
    h7-h8: rate=12.004 Mbps
    h9-h10: rate=11.137 Mbps

    Explanation: Connection speeds slows down due to two pairs of hosts communicating. The total throughput gets split according to number of hosts communicating
    simultaneously. But latency should remain the same because the connection between the two hosts remains the same regardless.


Q4) Prediction:
    The latency between the two pairs of hosts might remains the same:
    h1-h4: 160 ms
    h5-h6: 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 ms

    The throughput between h1 and h4 at max would be 20 Mbps due to the limiting bandwidth
    of L1. Meanwhile, the throughput betwee h5 and h6 at max would be 25 Mbps due to the
    identical bandwidth of L4 and L5.
    Therefore, the max throughput while the two pairs of
    hosts communicate simultaneously would be 45 Mbps (20 + 25 Mbps), and there would be a
    5 Mbps data loss total.

    Results:
    Latency
    h1-h4: rtt= 173.491 ms
    h5-h6: rtt= 57.604 ms

    Throughput:
    h1-h4: rate= 13.34 Mbps
    h5-h6: rate= 20.609 Mbps

    Explanation:
    Latency just as we expected, the same.
    Throughput slows down since both pairs of hosts are trying to send packets between them simultaneously through the same port and end up throttling the
    link connections between the hosts.
